# Events exersice


My first next.js thing

## Process:


1. Learning all the Next basics
 
 - I first started by understanding the basics,what server side props does what static does, the folder structure, the api folder all that sot of stuff, my priority was not making it pretty but understanding how next work, purdy was a bonus


2. Node
Prior to this i had 0 expirience with node, so creating my first api was like woah, and saving stuff in a json was incredible.

 - as you can see it took me quiete a few of attempts to get it working on vercel haha, it was a bit of a trail an error thing, but that's ok, the only ones who have never failed are the ones who never tried
